Hello! and welcome to my blog.

Over my years in IT community based resources have helped me out in numerous ways and also saved my skin more times that I care to remember! This blog is my attempt to try and give something back to the community and hopefully return the favour helping out others.

I'm also helping that I can use the blog as a location to document challenges or interesting pieces of work that I have come across to hopefully help myself in future.

Hopefully you will find some interesting information being posted overtime and please feel free to comment and provide feedback, good or bad!

Thanks!
