Hello! and welcome to my blog.

Over my years in IT community based resources have helped me out in numerous ways and also saved my skin more times than I care to remember! This blog is my attempt to try and give something back to the community and hopefully return the favour helping out others.

I'm also helping that I can use the blog as a location to document challenges or interesting pieces of work that I have come across to help.

The primary focus of the blog will be Microsoft azure but at times I may also dabble in other technology, or even talking about the human side of IT.

Hopefully you will find some interesting information being posted over time and please feel free to comment or contact me to provide feedback, good or bad!

Thanks!
